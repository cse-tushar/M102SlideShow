Lecture Notes

This video covers the course, in particular, MongoDB Deployments:

Standalone Deployment
Simplest MongoDB deployment: just one server. No redundancy, no scalings
Replica Set Deployment
Provides durability and availability
This involves replicating data to other servers, which can take over if the primary server goes down.
Sharded Cluster Deployment
Involves spreading your data across multiple "shards"
Each shard is its own replica set deployment.
Not only provides durability and availability, but it also scales.
